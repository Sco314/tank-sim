✅ Phase 5 Complete!
I've created the Pressure Sensor System with these files:
📁 New Files Created:

js/components/sensors/PressureSensor.js

Calculates pressure based on location (tank bottom, pump inlet/outlet, static)
Physics: P = ρgh (hydrostatic) + pump head + dynamic losses
Configurable alarms for high/low pressure warnings
4 measurement modes: atmospheric, tank_bottom, pump_inlet, pump_outlet, static


js/managers/PressureManager.js

Creates and manages all pressure sensors
Updates readings at 10Hz (100ms intervals)
Tracks active alarms system-wide
Provides min/max pressure monitoring


Updated js/config/systemConfig.js

Added 4 pressure sensors at strategic points:

P1: Tank bottom (monitors liquid column)
P2: Pump inlet (monitors suction, warns on cavitation)
P3: Pump outlet (monitors discharge, warns on overpressure)
P4: System outlet (monitors delivery pressure)




Updated index.html

Added PressureSensor.js and PressureManager.js scripts
Added "Pressure Sensors" status panel showing all 4 sensors
Real-time pressure readings with status indicators
